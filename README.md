# Unity-Utils
An on going collection of useful C# utility files for use with Unity. For now this repo is in beta and will remain as such for quite some time. It's meant more for my personal use as I work with various Unity projects.

# Supports
For use with Unity 5+ only.  It may work for Unity 4, however that remains untested.

# Features
**Timber**
- A verbose logging system. Provides convenience logging for various objects.

**Vectors**
- Adds additional Vector math routines, both statically and as extensions.

**GameObjects**
- Just a convenience method for determining if a GO needs instantiating or not.
